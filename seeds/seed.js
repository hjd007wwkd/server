(Oli Scarff/Getty Images)\nFaced with a 10 per cent tariff on its ketchup and other goods, American food company, Kraft Heinz is opening a new front in Canada's ketchup wars.\nHeinz took a public relations beating after moving its ketchup production to the U.S. in 2014, enabling Canadian-made French's ketchup to steal the spotlight. Now the company, which merged with Kraft in 2015, has begun its own PR campaign to highlight its Canadian connections, including the products it still makes in this country.\n"We are a good corporate citizen, and truly part of the Canadian fabric," said Av Maharaj, vice president of corporate affairs for Kraft Heinz Canada, shortly before the tariffs took effect on July 1.\n"The tariffs are just making things worse for them and that's why they're reacting," says food industry expert Sylvain Charlebois. However, he believes Kraft Heinz will garner little sympathy as Canada gets embroiled in a trade war with its neighbour.\n"It's all about politics — politics are trumping economics," said Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax.\nTariff tit for tat\nIn response to the U.S. imposing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, Ottawa has levied a 10 per cent tariff on many U.S. consumer imports — including ketchup and other products such as coffee and sauces that Kraft Heinz makes south of the border.\nThe company argues the tariffs it faces are unwarranted because it produces many other items in Canada, such as cheese and peanut butter, plus it employs more than 2,000 workers in this country\n"We don't think the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on Canada were particularly fair to Canada, and neither do we think the reciprocal tariffs that were imposed are equally fair," said Maharaj.\nTo add insult to injury, on Canada Day, Justin Trudeau is scheduled to visit a production plant in Leamington, Ont., that Heinz vacated in 2014.
